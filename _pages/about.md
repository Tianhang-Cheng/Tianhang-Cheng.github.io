Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tianhang Cheng (ç¨‹å¤©èˆª), currently a second-year master student in the Department of Computer Science, [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC), supervised by Prof. [Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/) and Prof. [Kaiyu Guan](http://faculty.nres.illinois.edu/~kaiyuguan/). I worked as a research assistant in Prof. [Xiaowei Zhou](https://xzhou.me/)'s Lab from May 2021 ~ May 2022, and Prof. [MingHsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/)'s Lab in Summer, 2021. My research interest lies in **3D reconstruction** and **3D generation** with neural representations (like NeRF, mesh, SDF, 3DGS, etc.). I am also interested in the intersection between optics and computer vision, and AI for science.

Previously, I graduated from [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University) in 2022 with a B.Eng. degree from the Department of Optical Science and Engineering and CHU KOCHEN Honors College, ranking in the top 5% (GPA:89.3). I won a National Scholarship (top 0.2%) in 2018.

I'm actively applying for a Ph.D. position in 2024 Fall!
