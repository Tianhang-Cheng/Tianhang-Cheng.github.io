I am currently a second-year master student in the Department of Computer Science, [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), supervised by [Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/) and [Kaiyu Guan](http://faculty.nres.illinois.edu/~kaiyuguan/). I graduated from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2022 with a B.Eng. degree from the Department of Optical Science and Engineering and [CHU KOCHEN Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/), ranking in the top 5% (GPA:89.3). My research interest lies in 3D reconstruction and 3D generation.
