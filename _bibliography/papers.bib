  abstract={The method to elaborately design the refractive index profile in the lower Riemann sheet of Zhukovski transformation plays an important role in the performance of this kind of conformal cloaks. However, for most proposed schemes, the mathematical calculations are complex. Here, we propose a more convenient method to design conformal cloaks by manipulating structures directly in the physical space. The designed cloak only needs symmetrical metal boundaries filled with normal dielectrics (refractive index ranges from 1 to 2) in the ‘circular branch cut’, which would be more feasible for future experimental implementation. Numerical simulations are performed by using the finite element method to validate our theoretical analysis.},
